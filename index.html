               Aside from that, I've also had prior job experiences working at a local pizza restaraunt during my college days. Additionally,
               I worked in Customer Support in an Amazon Locker Room Office for half a year before I took a year learn news skills to better myself.
               Nonetheless, in addition to having a well-rounded set of skills, I have quite the experience in dealing with all sorts of customers.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
               While I do have a bit of experience in Java, I plan on one day broaden my horizons by picking up a few more programming langauges here
               and there. Such as the mommonly used C++ and Python. Since I have an interest in game design, that is one of the many required seconary
               skills to pick up. Not to mention having to improve my own drawing as well. I vision myself one day helming my own big project with the
               variety of skills I have at my own disposal.
